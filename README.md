### Welcome to the code test.

This project supports Laravel Sail, but I used php artisan serve.

Node version locally used 16, although it should work with new versions.


```
npm install
php aritsan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
```
And then run both:
```
php artisan serve 
npm run dev
```
